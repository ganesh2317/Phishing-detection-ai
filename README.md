🛡️ AI-Based Phishing Detection System
📌 Overview

The AI-Based Phishing Detection System is a cybersecurity application that detects phishing emails, SMS messages, and URLs using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The system classifies inputs as phishing or legitimate and provides confidence scores and explanations.

This project is designed as a scalable, modular, and production-ready AI system suitable for real-world cybersecurity applications and academic projects.
